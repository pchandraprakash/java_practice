Below are the core concepts of Object Oriented Programming;
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Polymorphism

Inheritance: Is a process of acquiring properties/characteristics from parent class to child class
Parent class aka super or base class and Child class aka subclass or derived class

There are 4 types of inheritance;
single, multilevel, hierarchical and hybrid

single inheritance:

Class A
{
---
}
Class B extends A {
---
}

multilevel inheritance

Class A{
---
}
Class B extends A{
---
}
Class C extends B{
---
}

hierarchical inheritance:

Class A{
---
}
Class B extends A{
---
}
Class C extends A{
---
}

hybrid inheritance: aka Diamond Problem
this functionality is not supported by java but can be achieved through interfaces.
ex: class A is a parent class for class B and C, whereas Class B and C are the parent class of D
