Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.
Another way, it shows only important things to the user and hides the internal details for example answering a call, 
you just swipe green option and answer the call. You don't know the internal processing about the call transmission.

Abstraction lets you focus on what the object does instead of how it does it.
Ways to achieve Abstraction

There are two ways to achieve abstraction in java

- Abstract class (0 to 100% abstraction)
- Interface (100% abstraction)

Abstract Class:
An abstract class may contain abstract and concrete methods
An abstract class cannot be instantiated
multiple inheritance is not possible using abstract class

Interface:
Its a collection of abstract methods
It does not contain any concrete methods
multiple inheritance is possible using interfaces
